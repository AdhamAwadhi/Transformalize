# NEST [![Build Status](http://teamcity.codebetter.com/app/rest/builds/buildType:%28id:bt993%29/statusIcon)](http://teamcity.codebetter.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt993&guest=1)


*Strongly typed Elasticsearch client*

NEST aims to be a .net client with a very concise API. Its main goal is to provide a solid strongly typed Elasticsearch client. 

Indexing is as simple as:
```csharp
var post = new Post() { Id = 12, ... }
var result = client.Index(post);
````
All the calls have async variants:

```csharp
//t is a Task<ConnectionStatus>
var t = client.IndexAsync(post);
```
The typed client exposes a fluent interface and a [powerful query dsl](http://nest.azurewebsites.net/concepts/writing-queries.html)

```csharp
var results = client.Search<ElasticSearchProject>(s => s
	.From(0)
	.Size(10)
	.Fields(f => f.Id, f => f.Name)
	.SortAscending(f => f.LOC)
	.SortDescending(f => f.Name)
	.Query(q=>
		q.Term(f=>f.Name, "NEST", Boost: 2.0) 
		|| q.Match(mq=>mq.OnField(f=>f.Name).Query(userInput))
	)
);
```
NEST also comes with a low level client that you can fall back to incase anything is missing:
```csharp
//.Raw is of type IRawElasticClient
var results = this._client.Raw.SearchPost("myindex","elasticsearchprojects", new
{
	from = 0,
	size = 10,
	fields = new [] {"id", "name"},
	query = new {
		term = new {
			name = new {
				value= "NEST",
				boost = 2.0
			}
		}
	}
});
```
