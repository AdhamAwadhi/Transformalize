Released under GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0).

Transformalize is a combination of replication, transformation, and de-normalization.

It provides a reliable and efficient means of transforming relational data into a star-schema in near real-time.  
Among other uses, the output can be useful as a data source for an OLAP cube, a SOLR data import
handler, and/or a faster relational reporting data source.
