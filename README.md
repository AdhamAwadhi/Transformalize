Transformalize
==============
A combination of replication, transformation, and de-normalization.

The goal of Transformalize is to provide a reliable and efficient means of transforming and flattening relational data in
near real-time.  Among other uses, a flattened data set can be useful as a data source for an OLAP cube, a SOLR data import
handler, and/or a regular relational reporting data source.
